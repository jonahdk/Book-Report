      Story title: Treasure Island
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      My name: Jonah Kaufman
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Who is this passage about: The story is about a man who is afraid of a seafaring man with one leg.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      When and where does the story take place: It doesn't say where or when it takes place in the story.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      What problems does the character face: The story is following a man who is afraid of a seafaring man with one leg.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      What are the three main events that occur in the passage: In the passage, there is only one event. The seafaring man with one leg finds them, and then the story skips ahead.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      What did you learn in this passage: Being completely honest, nothing.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      What makes this passage a good example of historical fiction: I don't know, a person with one leg?
